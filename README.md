Grade 12 CS Mini-Project

Written in Java using NetBeans 8.2 IDE

This was a mini-project to review error-trapping skills from grade 11 Intro to CS. 
It gives the user a console menu where they can choose one of three options:
  A: input a postal code and have its format (A1A 1A1) verified
  B: input an integer and have its multiplication table 1 through 10 shown
  C: quit the program.
  
While loops, do-while loops & for loops are used along with a few try-catch statements to ensure
user gives proper input.
